# Change Log

## 0.1.2

- `manage.py` file dynamically located within the project, so it does not have to be at the root of the workspace anymore (still assuming there is only one Django project inside the workspace though, for now)

## 0.1.0 - 0.1.1

Initial release with very basic, but still useful, functionnalities.

-   Listing all available Django commands and executing the selected one
